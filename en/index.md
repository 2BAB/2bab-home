This is El, an Android GDE(Google Developer Expert) who currently resides in Singapore. 

I have worked on Android application infrastructure for years and enjoys exploring new technologies such as Gradle, AGP, KSP, bytecode transformation, modularity, etc. I delight in sharing Android development to the public via blog posts, podcasts, books, and conference presentations in English and Mandarin. In my spare time, I develop a number of interesting open-source plugins/utilities.

*2BAB* is my ID used at all platforms.
