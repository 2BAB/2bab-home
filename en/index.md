Hi, this is El. Currently based in Singapore, working around AI and mobile apps as a TL/EM at a vertical AI company.

I’ve previously been at Alibaba and VISA focusing on mobile infrastructure. Along the way, I wrote two books (like [*Extending Android Builds*](/en/book)) that got featured from the Gradle team. Outside of work, I run a podcast [Binary Radio](https://binary.2bab.me/) and a [Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@El-s-Space), and ccasionally dive into open source, talks, or writing.

I’m also an [Android GDE](https://developers.google.com/community/experts/directory?text=El%20Zhang), collaborating with Google on AI and Android evangelism. Always happy to chat, exchange ideas, and learn from others.

*2BAB* is my ID used at all platforms.
